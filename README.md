# JavaScript Jungle Retooling

### This project is a retooling/updating of a group project to which I contributed.
### Meant to be a clone of [StackOverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com), the original can be found [here](http://javascriptjungle.herokuapp.com), while the updated project can be found [here](http://jsjredux.herokuapp.com).

### This readme will serve as a running list of changes/updates/upgrades I've performed to the original codebase and data structure.

##### 12/07/2020 - Fixed a bug where voting and delete functionality was not active on AJAX-rendered new answers to a question.
##### 12/07/2020 - Created a new primary site user whose account is not accessible to the public, protecting the seeded content from unnecessary modifications.
